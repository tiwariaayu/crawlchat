Released three significant changes to Slack bot.

1. **Private channels** - Now the bot works even in private channels. Just add it the channel, tag and ask questions
2. **Lean** - Tag the bot and say **learn** in a thread so that it adds the entire thread conversation as a knowledge item
3. **Reply broadcast** - You can toggle whether to reply the answer as broadcast to the channel

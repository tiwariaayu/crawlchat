# CrawlChat

[CrawlChat](https://crawlchat.app) is an open sourced AI-powered platform that transforms your technical documentation into intelligent chatbots. Connect your documentation from various sources and deploy AI assistants that understand your content and answer questions across multiple channels including websites, Discord, Slack, and as an MCP server for integration with AI development tools.

You can self host it yourself or let [CrawlChat](https://crawlchat.app/pricing) handle it for you!

## Services

Here are the services it consists of. They are mostly simple **Node** + **TypeScript** apps.

| Name        | Purpose                                                         | Run           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |

| server      | LLM interacting [Express](https://expressjs.com) app            | `npm run dev` |

## Self-host

There are **Dockerfile**s for all the above mentioned services. You can instantly host on platforms like [Coolify](https://coolify.io), [Railway](https://railway.com), etc. by just setting up the **environment variables**

See the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/pskd73/crawlchat/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) on how to set up all basic services automatically.

## Local development

It takes just a few minutes to run it on your local machine so that you can develop on it and send PRs. It is explained in [LOCAL.md](https://github.com/pskd73/crawlchat/blob/main/LOCAL.md)

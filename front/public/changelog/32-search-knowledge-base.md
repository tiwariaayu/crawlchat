You can now **search your knowledge base** directly from the Knowledge page. Simply enter any query to find relevant pages across all your knowledge groups. This helps you in debugging pages against search queries and fine tune your documentation pages. You can also just pass the page `URL` to quickly navigate to it.

The search results display:
- **Group** - The knowledge group the page belongs to
- **URL** - Direct link to the page
- **Title** - The page title
- **Score** - Relevance score showing how well the page matches your query

All results are clickable, making it easy to navigate to the exact page you're looking for. Higher relevance scores are highlighted to help you find the most relevant content quickly.

Now Discord bot supports **images as attachments**. Users can just add screenshots or images in the message and ask questions. The bot can read the images and use the knowledge base to answer the queries.

You need to enable this option from Discord settings page and it is currently available only on **Pro** plan. You also need to make sure that you select the *AI model* that supports images as inputs for it to work.

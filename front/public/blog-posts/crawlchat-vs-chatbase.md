Both **Chatbase** and **CrawlChat** allow you to build AI chatbots powered by your own data — but they’re built with different users and purposes in mind. While Chatbase focuses on broad customer support and marketing use cases, CrawlChat is deeply tuned for **technical documentation and developer workflows**.

---

## Focus

**Chatbase** is a general-purpose AI chatbot platform that helps businesses automate customer support, lead generation, and user engagement on their websites. It’s designed for teams that need quick setup and broad integrations across tools and data types.

**CrawlChat**, on the other hand, is built for **developer teams**. It specializes in creating AI assistants that understand technical documentation — including API references, SDK guides, and changelogs — making it ideal for companies that maintain complex developer portals or knowledge bases.

---

## Actions: Going Beyond Simple Q&A

Both platforms have evolved beyond simple question-answer chatbots with the addition of **Actions** — features that let chatbots execute tasks or fetch live data.

**Chatbase Actions** are designed for wide business use cases. They can call APIs, update CRMs, trigger workflows, or integrate with tools like Zapier. It’s a great fit for teams automating support or sales operations.

**CrawlChat Actions**, in contrast, focus on **developer-specific interactions**. They can connect with technical tools, retrieve real-time data, or process developer queries contextually. Instead of just answering “how-to” questions, CrawlChat bots can trigger workflows or fetch structured data that matters to engineering and documentation teams.

## Knowledge and Context Handling

When it comes to understanding and organizing data, **Chatbase** allows you to upload files or link websites for training. However, maintaining document hierarchy and cross-page relationships often requires additional setup and manual structure.

**CrawlChat** excels here. It **automatically crawls websites**, GitHub repositories, Notion spaces, and Confluence pages — preserving the structure, hierarchy, and context of the documentation. This makes it particularly strong at handling nested developer content like API endpoints, SDK examples, and changelogs.

---

## Analytics and Insights

**Chatbase** provides comprehensive analytics that track user interactions, chat history, message confidence, and overall chatbot performance. These metrics help teams optimize chatbot accuracy and customer satisfaction.

**CrawlChat** takes analytics a step further by introducing **“data gap” insights** — a feature that highlights the questions users asked but your documentation couldn’t answer. This helps developer teams continuously improve their documentation by identifying missing or unclear information.

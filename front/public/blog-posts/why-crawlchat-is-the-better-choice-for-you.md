Building an AI assistant from your documentation sounds simple until you try to make it actually work for your team. For small and mid-sized companies, it’s not just about creating a chatbot that gives answers; it’s about how fast you can set it up, how easily it integrates with your workflows, and how affordable it is to maintain.  

Most popular tools are built with large enterprises in mind, with lots of analytics, complex dashboards, and heavy pricing tiers. **CrawlChat** takes a different route. It’s designed specifically for lean teams that move fast, focus on technical documentation, and want AI that works inside Slack, Discord, and their docs with zero friction.  

Let’s break down how CrawlChat compares to **Kapa.ai**, **Chatbase.co**, **DocsBot.ai**, and **SiteGPT.ai**, and why it’s the more practical choice for small to mid-sized teams.

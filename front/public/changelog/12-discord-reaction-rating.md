Now the [**Discord bot**](/discord-bot) supports rating the bot messages using reactions. Community can react with 👍🏻 or 👎 emojis for the bot messages to rate it up or down respectfully. It calculates number of reactions and rate the majority (higher preference to rate down).

These ratings would show up on the dashboard as usual and can be used to fine tune the bot's knowledge.
